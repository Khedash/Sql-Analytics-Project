## 1.  Introduction
This project explores a diabetes dataset containing patient demographic and clinical information.  
The goal is to identify patterns, trends, and risk indicators related to diabetes using SQL.  
By querying the dataset, we uncover how factors such as gender, BMI, age, hypertension, and heart disease relate to diabetes prevalence.
